# Airbnb Clone Backend Requirements

# This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for three key backend features: User Authentication, Property Management, and Booking System. Each feature includes API endpoints, inputs/outputs, validation rules, and performance criteria.

1. User Authentication

Purpose: Let users sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.

## Functional Requirements
Users can register with an email and password.
Users can log in with their credentials.
Passwords must be securely hashed.
Issue a JWT (JSON Web Token) upon successful login.
Support password reset via email.

## Technical Requirements


# API Endpoints:
POST /api/auth/register
Input: JSON with email (string, required), password (string, min 8 chars, required), name (string, optional).
Output: JSON with user_id (string), message (string, e.g., "User created").


# Validation:
Email must be valid (e.g., user@domain.com).
Password must be 8+ chars, include 1 letter and 1 number.
Return 400 if email exists or input is invalid.



POST /api/auth/login
Input: JSON with email (string, required), password (string, required).
Output: JSON with token (JWT string), user_id (string).


# Validation:
Return 401 if credentials are incorrect.


POST /api/auth/reset-password
Input: JSON with email (string, required).
Output: JSON with message (string, e.g., "Reset link sent").

# Validation:
Email must exist in the system.
Return 404 if email not found.

## Performance Criteria:
Response time: < 200ms for login/register under normal load.
Handle 1,000 concurrent login requests with < 1% failure rate.
JWT tokens expire in 24 hours.

2. Property Management
Purpose: Allow hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.

## Functional Requirements
Hosts can add a new property with details like title, description, and price.
Hosts can update or delete their own properties.
Only authenticated users (hosts) can manage properties.

## Technical Requirements
API Endpoints:

POST /api/properties
Input: JSON with title (string, required), description (string, optional), price (number, required), location (string, required), host_id (string, required).
Output: JSON with property_id (string), message (string, e.g., "Property created").

Validation:
Title: 5–100 chars.
Prce: Positive number.
Host_id must match authenticated user.
Return 401 if unauthorized, 400 if invalid input.

PUT /api/properties/:id
Input: JSON with title (string, optional), description (string, optional), price (number, optional), location (string, optional).
Output: JSON with property_id (string), message (string, e.g., "Property updated").

# Validation:
Only the property’s host can update.
Return 403 if unauthorized, 404 if property not found.



DELETE /api/properties/:id
Input: None (uses :id from URL).
Output: JSON with message (string, e.g., "Property deleted").

# Validation:
Only the property’s host can delete.
Return 403 if unauthorized, 404 if property not found.

# Performance Criteria:
Response time: < 300ms for create/update/delete under normal load.
Support 500 concurrent property updates with < 1% failure rate.

3. Booking System
Purpose: Enable users to book properties and view their bookings.

## Functional Requirements

Users can book a property for specific dates.
Users can view their booking history.
Prevent double-booking of a property for the same dates.

## Technical Requirements

# API Endpoints:
POST /api/bookings
Input: JSON with property_id (string, required), user_id (string, required), start_date (date, required), end_date (date, required).
Output: JSON with booking_id (string), message (string, e.g., "Booking confirmed").

# Validation:
Dates must be valid and end_date > start_date.
Property must be available for requested dates.
Return 400 if dates overlap or input is invalid, 401 if unauthorized.

GET /api/bookings/user/:user_id
Input: None (uses :user_id from URL).
Output: JSON array of bookings with booking_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status.

# Validation:
Only the user can view their bookings.
Return 403 if unauthorized, 404 if no bookings found.

## Performance Criteria:
Response time: < 250ms for booking creation, < 200ms for listing bookings.
Handle 1,000 concurrent booking requests with < 1% failure rate.
